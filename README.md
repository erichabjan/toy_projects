# toy_projects
These miscellaneous notebooks are a collection of the small projects I have worked on to learn about physics or programming.

**Harmonic_Oscillator.ipynb** In this notebook I propogate a one dimensional harmonic oscillator in time and find the energy of different stationary states. 


**Stellar_Model_Midterm** In this folder there is a juputer notebook and a PDF that show my solutions to a midterm in my stars and compact object course. I modeled the interiors of various types of stars with my code written in the jupyter notebook and my written explanations are shown in the PDF file. The premise of this midterm was to show what physical implications some of our assumptions discussed in class had on the interior of stars like our Sun and the white dwarf Sirirus B.
